# Brain Tumor Segmentation with nnU-Net

This repository contains all the code and materials I developed during a project focused on brain tumor segmentation using the **BraTS 2020 dataset** and the **nnU-Net** framework.

## ðŸ§  Project Context

This work was conducted as part of my **7th period in college** and serves as a foundational step toward my **undergraduate thesis**. The goal was to become familiar with the complete workflow of medical image segmentation, including:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training and inference using nnU-Net
- Visual analysis of predictions
- Performance evaluation with metrics like Dice Score and confusion matrices

Although this project was developed in an academic setting, much of my learning happened independently. I dedicated significant time outside the classroom to study documentation, research papers, and books to deeply understand the principles behind each step.

## ðŸ“‚ Notebooks

- `nnUNet.ipynb`: My **initial test notebook**, used during the exploration phase. It contains experiments, configurations, and intermediate trials.
- `Vis_Comp_Final.ipynb`: The **final, optimized version** of the notebook. This includes the full pipeline: visualization, evaluation, and a more polished version of the experiments.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Tools & Libraries

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NiBabel)
- nnU-Net (v2)
- BraTS 2020 dataset (20% subset)
- Google Colab (for training and inference)
- Git for version control and reproducibility

## ðŸ“Ž Note

This project was built entirely for educational purposes, to enhance my knowledge in **Machine Learning**, **Medical Image Analysis**, and **Deep Learning** techniques applied to real clinical data.
